# Improving Code Quality with Static Analysis

## Abstract

If you arenâ€™t using automated static analysis then time is being wasted during code review.

As the art of programming has evolved, patterns have emerged that can describe code in quantitative terms. Static analysis is the task of looking for those patterns in code, whether they are for code style, complexity, or security vulnerabilities. While identifying these patterns are often the manual task of code review, automation can be done in a fraction of the time and cost and with greater accuracy.

In this session we will look at how to use static analysis on a project to identify incorrect code using Code Climate as an example. The key takeaway for this session is an understanding of static analysis and how to tie its automation into the development cycle of a project to improve code quality.
