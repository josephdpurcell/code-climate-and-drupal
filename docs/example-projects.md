# Example Projects

The following examples use the PHPCS sniffs supported by their respective communities, and the same phpmd file. The result should be a somewhat objective comparison of how each code base meets its own code style, as well as the checks from PHPMD, such as complexity or unused variables.

Note: these GPA's are likely out of date, so verify the commit Code Climate has matches with the latest commit.
